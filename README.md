# C-Programming
C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.
It is a very popular language, despite being old.
C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.
## Why Learn C?
It is one of the most popular programming language in the world.

If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#, etc, as the syntax is similar.

C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python.

C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and technologies.

This file shows a simple program that takes input from the user and displays it to the user.

#### Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values, like numbers and characters. In C, there are different types of variables (i.e., Data Types) these are as follows:

int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes

#### Functions
A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
Functions are used to perform certain actions, and they are important for reusing code: Define the code once, and use it many times.
`main()` is a function, which is used to execute code, and `printf()` is a function; used to output/print text to the screen
